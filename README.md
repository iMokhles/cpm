# `cpm` [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CharizTeam/cpm.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/CharizTeam/cpm)
cpm is the Chariz Package Manager. It defines a modern repo format for Debian packages (.deb files) to be used along with the [Chariz](https://chariz.io/) package management interface for OS X. It also allows these packages to depend on formulae from [Homebrew](https://github.com/homebrew/Homebrew) and casks from [Homebrew Cask](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask).
